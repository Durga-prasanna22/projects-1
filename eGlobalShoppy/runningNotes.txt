    Sub step 1: send data/file through fomdata from client side 
    sub step 2: Receive file at serverside and copy/upload to specific folder 
                under public folder - using multer node module
Step 2: Upload product details along with image url to server -> service


At server side to upload a file , we use multer nodemodule 

    var multer = require("multer");

    var storage = multer.diskStorage({
        destination: '',
        filename: ''
    })

    var upload = multer.storage(storage).single("prodImage")

    upload(req, res, () => {
        
    })
